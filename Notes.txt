RPN_TRAIN_ANCHORS_PER_IMAGE
POST_NMS_ROIS_TRAINING
TRAIN_ROIS_PER_IMAGE

POST_NMS_ROIS_TRAINING is the number of ROIs generated by the RPN network.
Out of those, we pick a subset of TRAIN_ROIS_PER_IMAGE to use to train the 2nd stage classifier.
Think of TRAIN_ROIS_PER_IMAGE as the batch size for the 2nd stage. The larger it is, the more memory you need.

RPN_TRAIN_ANCHORS_PER_IMAGE is set according to the Faster R-CNN paper, Section 3.1.3, Training RPNs. It seems that 256 is randomly chosen and there's no hard rationale for this number. You can treat this as a hyper-parameter.
